## Introduction

Software architecture is the process of defining a structured solution that meets all of the technical and operational requirements of a software system.
It is usually represented using a set of views or perspectives in which the system's components are shown as well as its relationships to each other and the environment.

We will use the **4 + 1 view model** to describe Mopidy's architecture.

## The 4 + 1 architectural view model

+ **Logical view** : The logical view shows the key abstractions in the system as object classes or their packages.
+ **Implementation view** : The implementation view shows how the software is decomposed (into components) for development.
+ **Deployment view** : The deployment view describes how the system hardware and software components are distributed.
+ **Process view** : The process view shows how the system is composed of interacting processes.

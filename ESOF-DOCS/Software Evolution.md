## Introduction

As new requirements are laid upon the existing software there is the need for the product to evolve and respond to remain useful . As software products can be extensively complex , this evolution can be extremely expensive and very difficult, so there are specific processes to make it happen with ease.
As a closure to our semester research our group was assigned to identify a part of this open-source project and develop/create it. Although we lack the practice and knowledge of Python we'll try to synthesise the whole process of Software Evolution and show an example of a feature implementation.
